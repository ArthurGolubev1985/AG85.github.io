<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">AG85DCF1 defines the
following entities:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	1. Dictionaries –
in custom way provide dictionary words so that there exists sequence
numbering of the dictionary words through the dictionary;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	2. Dictionary
extracts – of the following format:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">		2.1. Dictionary
extract part 1 – in either system or program/application/task
defined format identification of used for defining the dictionary
extract dictionaries so that there exists sequence order of the
dictionaries;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">		2.2. Dictionary
extract part 2 – considering Sequence 1 is sequence of numbers of
all dictionary words of all designated by dictionary extract part 1
dictionaries with sequencing dictionary words through all
dictionaries in orders of as the dictionaries are provided in
dictionary extract part 1 and of as dictionary words are sequenced in
the dictionaries a data structure ag85dst2 with presences
representing disjoint ranges in the Sequence 1 by alternating begins
and ends of the ranges and considering Sequence 2 is sequence of
values in the ranges in order of Sequence 1 a data structure ag85dsp1
with present states representing numbers of being including in the
dictionary extract dictionary words in Sequence 2 and not present
states representing numbers of not being included in the dictionary
extract dictionary words in Sequence 2 so that the ranges are such
that both there are no numbers of being included in the dictionary
extract dictionary words out of the ranges and the both data
structures are as little information as possible to archive changing
the ranges.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	3. Archives – of
the following format:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">		3.1. Archive part
1 – in either system or program/application/task defined format
identification what data is compressed into the archive;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">		3.2. Archive part
2 – in either system or program/application/task defined format
identification of used to make the archive dictionary extracts so
that there exists sequence order of the dictionary extracts;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">		3.3. is empty if
no grammar compression, Archive part 3 – in either system or
program/application/task format identifiers of grammar programs and
devices required for performing grammar decompression in order as
processing by grammar programs and grammar devices is required;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">		3.4. exists if
archive part 3 is not empty, Archive part 4 – pieces of information
for grammar decompression in order as processing by grammar programs
and grammar devices is required.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">		3.5. Archive part
5 – considering Sequence 3 is sequence of numbers of all dictionary
words provided marked as used by all designated by archive part 2
dictionary extracts with sequencing dictionary words through all
dictionary extracts in orders of as the dictionary extracts are
provided in archive part 2 and of as dictionary words are sequenced
in the dictionary extracts a data structure ag85dst2 with presences
representing disjoint ranges in the Sequence 3 by alternating begins
and ends of the ranges and considering Sequence 4 is sequence of
values in the ranges in order of Sequence 3 a data structure ag85dsp1
with present states representing numbers of not used by the archive
dictionary words in Sequence 4 and not present states representing
numbers of used by the archive dictionary words in Sequence 4 so that
the ranges are such that both there are no numbers of not used by the
archive dictionary words out of the ranges and the both data
structures are as little information as possible to archive changing
the ranges.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">		3.6. Archive part
6 – for every used dictionary word a data structure ag85dst2 data
structure with presences representing one of the following:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">			3.6.1. if archive
part 7 is not empty, position numbers of starting bytes of
occurrences of the dictionary word in sequence of bytes of data
compressed into the archive;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">			3.6.2. if archive
part 7 is empty, position numbers of occurrences of the dictionary
word in sequence of dictionary words corresponding to pieces of data
compressed into the archive without restrictions of how to convert
pieces of data into words in variate cases. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">		3.7. is empty if
there were no such data pieces in compressed into the archive data,
Archive part 7 – in the same order as in the data compressed into
the archive pieces of data which are out pieces of data corresponding
to dictionary words values in the data compressed into the archive.</p>
